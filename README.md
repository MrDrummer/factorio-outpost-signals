# What's this for?!
Factorio is a game I have played far too many hours in (as is tradition!) and I always find myself confused when using traditional methods to encode/decode signals in the game's logic network.
So I created a mod that added a ton of signals to the game that are easy to reference and are self-descriptive.

I don't do Lua. At the time, I was into PHP, and then Node.js. So naturally I made a tool that generated the lua files for me!

Using Jimp and base files, I generate the icons I want, and it'll render the icons for me!
